//TODO: Create Thread Component

//This component takes props
//At first a thread should simply display the thread name, description, post count, and when the last post was created
//Upon being clicked, the component should expand as a modal pop up and display everything mentioned previously in one section, with all posts following below sorted by oldest to most recent in a text-messenger style format. There should be a sticky input text field at the very bottom of the modal, where new posts can be made, submitted via button.

//Later on, we should limit how many posts are seen at a time so that the user doesnt have to scroll so far down. EX: loads 5 posts upon pop-up, and theres a button to load the next five, etc.
