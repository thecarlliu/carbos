//TODO: Create Home Page

//From top to bottom:
//A full-wide and animated section that shows our slogan, and welcomes users to the site.
//Below, we want three cards to represent the Docs, Templates, and Forum sections.
//Each section should link to the appropriate route.

//This page is the best place to express our creativity. Themes, patterns, characters, designs, whatever -- The content on this page has to "hook" our customer.
