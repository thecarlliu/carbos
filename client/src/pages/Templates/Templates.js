//TODO: Create Templates Page

//Import Template component

//Make a Card for each category found in db.Template
//Each Card should have the appropriate image, title, and description
//When clicked, the card should either expand, or a modal is triggered to display all templates found within that category.
//Each template should be displayed via our Template component, passing in the appropriate props.
